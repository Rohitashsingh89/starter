# React Starter Kit

This is a simple guide to help you set up a basic React project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Create a new React app

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

This will create a new React app in a folder called `my-react-app` and navigate into that folder.

## Start the development server

Inside your project folder, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open your React app in your default web browser. You can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

The basic project structure will look like this:

```
my-react-app/
|-- src/
|   |-- index.js
|   |-- App.js
|   |-- App.css
|-- public/
|   |-- index.html
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

- `src/`: Contains your application code.
- `public/`: Contains static assets and the main HTML file.
- `package.json`: Defines your project dependencies and scripts.

## Additional Setup

You might want to explore other tools and libraries to enhance your React development experience:

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): For handling navigation in your app.
- [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): For styling React components with tagged template literals.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): For making HTTP requests.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
